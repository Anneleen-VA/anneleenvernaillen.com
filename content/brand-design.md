# Brand Design<br>Your story visualised

I am a creative Art Director specialised in logo design and brand creation.

**Logo & Design**

Every brand (company, event, product line, …) has something to tell. My goal as graphic designer is to listen and observe, to gather insight and **turn your vision, your story into a visual identity**. 

With your audience in mind, I start creating your brand’s personality based on **its strengths and values. I’ll guide you through the process in understanding the relationship between business and design**. 

Satisfied with the logo, the corporate identity? 
Then I edit your visuals to build an identity that works across multiple formats and platforms (web, print, presentations, video, …)

**Brand Creation**

During my creative process, juggling typography, colour, … I automatically have “**a tone of voice**” in mind for titles, additional imagery, … 

Reinforcing the graphic identity through **photography and copywriting** enhances the personality of your brand. Aligning all these elements on e.g. your website, your social media channels, … creates consistent marketing. 

I like to **advice and guide** you in the right direction **for your marketing & communication approach and elaboration**, because paying attention to uniformity pays off. **Making your brand more powerful**.
