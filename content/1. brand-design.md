# Brand & communication design

Looking to elevate your brand, event, product or service? Look no further.

I’m a creative director specialized in brand design and communication. My experience goes from technical B2B-industries to the creative and cultural sectors.

**Having me as your creative director, means**

**1. Creating a greater impact by attracting positive attention**

You gain acces to fresh and creative perspectives. My experience brings you a **nuanced understanding** of how to visually shape and communicate your brand's story. 

I dive deep into understanding your core values and mission, I question assumptions and challenge traditional norms to offer you **a creative yet practical brand strategy**.

**2. Finding balance between creativity and functionality**

I stand for a creative approach with meticulous **attention to detail** applied to your entire identity, balancing creativity with **functionality and effectiveness**. 

Moreover, I understand the communication lifecycle and can **tailor and coordinate your campaigns** in line with your target audience.

**3. You can Trust the process**

Delivering your project **on time** without sacrificing quality is crucial, right?

Whether **managing your project**, encouraging teamwork or handling things on my own, I thrive in a collaborative environment and make sure **things get done effectively and efficiently**, so you can sleep on both ears.

\:br\:br  **With a smile at your service. Ready to see your vision come to life?**
