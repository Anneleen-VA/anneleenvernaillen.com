# Wall art:brPhotographic Observations. Interpretations

::div{.col-left}
How much or how little must we see for our mind to register and complete an image correctly? What happens when we cross that line? **Where does reality end and (our) imagination takes over?**

An exploratory process that arose during my nature walks, from the wonder and admiration on my path. At the base: **own (local) images processed** in tune with my memory of the observation and the feeling that went with it.

A picture says more than a thousand words, but nothing beats seeing the work in real life of course.  Curious to see an example? Interested?\*
Don't hesitate and **start the conversation**

\*All work can be custom ordered.
