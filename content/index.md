## Core

### Celebrating creative individuality & expression. 
**That’s what I like to stand for. Anywhere. Anytime.**

Ever since my childhood, I’ve been drawing, painting,… creating. For me being creative is **the expression of a process**, is growing, moving forward. The love for this process, the love for **creative growth** brought me to where I am today. The combination of **fine arts, graphic design and marketing & event**

**management** covers a lot of different areas. Too many? No. I only have one question in mind: does it fit my creative path & personal growth? If yes, then **I go for it!** 
It flows through my veins: **being creative is what I am, it is my core**.
