I can't believe this moment has arrived. Yep, I am saying goodbye to the vibrant, creative events industry and taking the plunge towards **my own vibrant journey as an independent visual artist**. ðŸ”¥

Visual artist? Well, creative expression, that's what I'm all about. For me being creative is the expression of a process and the love for this process, the love for creative growth brought me to where I am today. 
So, whereâ€™s that?

With **brand design**, I'll focus on creative guidance throughout yÃ³ur process. Need a new - more creative - chapter for your brand, product, company,...? I am your go-to for your **visual marketing**. From strategy & design to realisation, Iâ€™ll guide you seamlessly through the entire process. **Together, weâ€™ll make your branding pop and your product stand out**. 

In addition, I continue on my **personal** path through **digital wall art** and **ceramics**. A journey that does not have 100% shape at the moment, but offers all the more possibilities. ðŸ™‚

For the past ten years, I have been self-employed besides my full-time job with a sporadic assignment here and there - I did not promote this at all. So a 10-year anniversaryâ€¦  **time to go full steam ahead!** 

*I am grateful for all the support and encouragement I have received from my family and friends. Their support has given me the confidence to take this step.* 

I am excited to see what new adventures this chapter holds. <br>
**This is only the beginning!**
