# Ceramics<br>The purity of porcelain

:::div{.col-left}

The behavior of clay on a wheel - and porcelain in particular - **fascinates me** beyond words. This craftmanship requires concentration, practice and focus, but the tranquility it brings… so zen. A wonderful craft and material to explore…

 **This pure and delicate material fits perfectly with my personal preference for sleek design**. Here too, I look for that straightforward approach without bells and whistles, **the virtue of pure forms**. By combining my photographic interpretations with the purity of porcelain, I have found a voice of my own which perfectly reflects my personality.

## Sculptural objects

How do I enhance my photographic interpretations through the medium and its form? At what point do I take the object completely out of context? How long does the object continue to trigger the mind? A fascinating study that will never end.
