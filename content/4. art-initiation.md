# Art Initiation<br>discover the power of creativity

:::div{.col-left}

Creating makes me evolve more consciously and brings me peace. **Through my creations, I find more balance**. Starting from that strong personal vision, I want to **encourage creative experiences** with the aim of making people aware of the power of creativity.

I shared this vision on creativity before and found that it really energises people, and that even encourages me more.

I like to take this experience to a higher, more individual level via workshops. I don’t have a concrete approach or interpretation (yet). But I ‘d love to start a dialogue with you and who knows what creative elaboration we can come up with together….

### Let's talk.

**Celebrating creative individuality & expression.**<br>
**That’s what I like to stand for. Anywhere. Anytime.**
